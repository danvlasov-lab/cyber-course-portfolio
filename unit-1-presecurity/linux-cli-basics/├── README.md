**Date:** 2026-09-5

**Source:** (Assignment ID, e.g. U1-05b — Linux CLI Basics)

**Environment:** Debian VM

## Goal
To become comfortable with the essential Linux command-line tools I will use throughout this course and build the muscle memory for navigation, file manipulation, viewing, searching, redirection, and package management on Debian 13.

# Linux Cyber Course — Parts 1–12

## Part 1 Getting your bearings

### Q1 — What username are you logged in as?

Command:

```bash
$ whoami
```

Output:

```text
varia
```

**Answer:** I am logged in as the user `varia`.

---

### Q2 — Are you a member of the `sudo` group? How can you tell from the output of `id`?

Command:

```bash
$ id
```

Output:

```text
uid=1000(varia) gid=1000(varia) groups=1000(varia),27(sudo)
```

**Answer:** Yes. I am a member of the `sudo` group because `sudo` appears in the list of groups.

---

### Q3 — What kernel version is your system running?

Command:

```bash
$ uname -a
```

Output:

```text
Linux debian-lab 6.12.107+deb13-arm64 #1 SMP Debian 6.12.107-1 (2026-08-29) aarch64 GNU/Linux
```

**Answer:** The system is running Linux kernel `6.12.107+deb13-arm64`.

---

### Q4 — What is the difference in the depth of information they give you?

Commands:

```bash
$ whatis whoami
$ man whoami
```

Output from `whatis`:

```text
whoami (1) - print effective user name
```

**Answer:** `whatis` gives a very short, one-line description of the command. `man` provides a much more detailed manual page, including the command's purpose, syntax, description, options, and other information.

---

### Q5 — While in `man`, how do you (a) search for the word "user" and (b) quit?

**Answer:**

* To search for `user`, press `/`, type `user`, and press `Enter`.
* To quit `man`, press `q`.

---

# Part 2 Navigation

### Q6 — What did `cd -` do?

Commands:

```bash
$ cd /etc
$ pwd
$ cd ..
$ pwd
$ cd /var/log
$ pwd
$ cd -
$ pwd
```

**Answer:** `cd -` switches back to the previous working directory. It is useful for quickly moving between the current directory and the directory visited immediately before it.

---

### Q7 — What additional information does `-l` give you over plain `ls`?

Command:

```bash
$ ls -l /etc
```

Output (excerpt):

```text
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  3028 Mar 12 09:14 adduser.conf
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Oct 21 14:02 apt
```

**Answer:** `-l` shows the long format — permissions, link count, owner, group, size, modification date, and name.

---

### Q8 — What does `-a` show that wasn't visible before? Name two examples from the output.

Command:

```bash
$ ls -la /etc
```

**Answer:** `-a` shows hidden files and directories that are normally omitted by `ls`.

Examples include:

```text
.
..
```

---

### Q9 — What is the largest file in `/var/log`? What size is it?

Command:

```bash
$ ls -lh /var/log
```

Output:

```text
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 786K Sep  5 13:57 dpkg.log
```

**Answer:** The largest regular file shown in `/var/log` is `dpkg.log`, with a size of approximately `786K`.

---

### Q10 — What was modified most recently?

Command:

```bash
$ ls -lt /var/log
```

Output (top entries):

```text
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 804285 Sep  5 13:57 dpkg.log
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 Sep  5 13:57 apt
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  46882 Sep  5 13:57 alternatives.log
```

**Answer:** The most recently modified items were `dpkg.log`, the `apt` directory, and `alternatives.log`, all modified at `13:57` on September 5.

---

# Part 3 Creating and managing files

### Q11 — Show the command (or commands) you used.

Command:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/cyber-course/unit1
$ mkdir -p ~/cyber-course/unit2
$ mkdir -p ~/cyber-course/unit3/osint
$ mkdir -p ~/cyber-course/unit3/recon
$ mkdir -p ~/cyber-course/unit3/crypto
$ mkdir -p ~/cyber-course/scratch
```

**Answer:** The directory structure was created under `~/cyber-course/`, including `unit1`, `unit2`, `unit3/osint`, `unit3/recon`, `unit3/crypto`, and `scratch`.

---

### Q12 — What key combination did you use to save? What key combination did you use to exit?

**Answer:**

* Save: `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`
* Exit: `Ctrl+X`

---

### Q13 — Why did `rmdir` fail (or succeed)?

Command:

```bash
$ rmdir ~/cyber-course/scratch/
```

**Answer:** `rmdir` fails when the directory is not empty. In this task, `scratch/` contained files, so it could not be removed with `rmdir`.

The directory was then removed with:

```bash
$ rm -r ~/cyber-course/scratch/
```

---

# Part 4 Viewing files

### Q14 — Which Debian version do you have?

Command:

```bash
$ cat /etc/os-release
```

Output:

```text
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)"
NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="13"
VERSION="13 (trixie)"
DEBIAN_VERSION_FULL=13.6
ID=debian
```

**Answer:** The system is running **Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)**.

---

### Q15 — What kind of messages do you see? Are they recent?

Command:

```bash
$ sudo tail -n 10 /var/log/syslog
```

Output:

```text
tail: cannot open '/var/log/syslog' for reading: No such file or directory
```

**Answer:** No messages could be displayed because `/var/log/syslog` does not exist on this system.

The system uses the systemd journal instead. The equivalent command was:

```bash
$ sudo journalctl -n 10
```

Output (excerpt):

```text
Sep 05 14:17:01 debian-lab CRON[3826]: (root) CMD ...
Sep 05 14:17:35 debian-lab sudo[3828]: varia : TTY=pts/0 ...
Sep 05 14:18:13 debian-lab sudo[3835]: varia : TTY=pts/0 ...
Sep 05 14:18:49 debian-lab sudo[3842]: varia : TTY=pts/0 ...
```

**Answer:** The messages include `CRON` activity and `sudo` session messages. They are recent, from September 5, 2026.

---

# Part 5 Searching

### Q16 — How many lines were returned? (Hint: pipe to `wc -l`.)

Command:

```bash
$ grep "ssh" /etc/services | wc -l
```

Output:

```text
1
```

**Answer:** `1` line was returned.

The matching entry was:

```text
ssh        22/tcp        # SSH Remote Login Protocol
```

---

### Q17 — How would you modify the command to show only `.conf` files modified in the last 7 days?

Command:

```bash
$ find /etc -name "*.conf" -mtime -7
```

**Answer:** `-mtime -7` restricts the results to files modified less than 7 days ago.

---

### Q18 — Where are these commands actually located on the filesystem?

Commands:

```bash
$ which ls
$ which nano
```

**Answer:** These commands can be located with `which`. The output gives the executable's path, for example:

```text
/usr/bin/ls
/usr/bin/nano
```

---

# Part 6 History, redirection, and pipes

### Q19 — What does the `|` symbol do here?

Command:

```bash
$ history | tail -n 20
```

**Answer:** The pipe `|` sends the output of the command on its left (`history`) directly to the input of the command on its right (`tail`). This displays only the last 20 history entries.

---

### Q20 — What is the difference between `>` and `>>`?

Commands:

```bash
$ ls -la ~/cyber-course/ > ~/listing.txt
$ date >> ~/listing.txt
```

**Answer:**

* `>` creates or overwrites a file with the command output.
* `>>` appends the output to the end of an existing file without deleting its previous contents.

---

### Q21 — What was the output, and why?

Command:

```bash
$ echo "hello cyber world" | grep "cyber"
```

Output:

```text
hello cyber world
```

**Answer:** `echo` produced the sentence and the pipe passed it to `grep`. Since the sentence contains the word `cyber`, `grep` printed the entire matching line.

---

# Part 7 Archives

### Q22 — Confirm with `ls -la` that the extraction worked. What did you find inside?

Commands:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/test-extract
$ cd ~/test-extract
$ unzip ~/cyber-course/unit1.zip
$ ls -la
```

**Answer:** The extraction worked. The extracted directory contained `unit1/`, including the `intro.txt` file created earlier.

---

### Q23 — What do the flags `c`, `z`, `v`, and `f` each mean?

Command:

```bash
$ tar -czvf unit2.tar.gz unit2/
```

**Answer:**

| Flag | Meaning                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| `c`  | Create a new archive          |
| `z`  | Compress using gzip           |
| `v`  | Verbose output                |
| `f`  | Specify the archive file name |

---

# Part 8 Permissions

### Q24 — Paste the permission string. Can the owner execute the file?

Command:

```bash
$ touch ~/cyber-course/hello.sh
$ ls -l ~/cyber-course/hello.sh
```

Output:

```text
-rw-r--r-- 1 varia varia 0 Sep 5 13:25 /home/varia/cyber-course/hello.sh
```

**Answer:** The permission string is:

```text
-rw-r--r--
```

No, the owner cannot execute the file because the owner's permissions are only `rw-`. There is no `x` permission.

---

### Q25 — What happened, and why?

Command:

```bash
$ ~/cyber-course/hello.sh
```

**Answer:** The script could not be executed because it did not have execute permission.

---

### Q26 — What does the new permission string look like? Did the script run this time?

Commands:

```bash
$ chmod u+x ~/cyber-course/hello.sh
$ ls -l ~/cyber-course/hello.sh
$ ~/cyber-course/hello.sh
```

Output:

```text
-rwxr--r-- 1 varia varia 46 Sep 5 13:25 /home/varia/cyber-course/hello.sh
```

Script output:

```text
Hello from my first script
```

**Answer:** The new permission string is `-rwxr--r--`. Yes, the script ran successfully because the owner now has execute permission.

---

### Q27 — What does `700` mean in plain language?

Command:

```bash
$ chmod 700 ~/cyber-course/hello.sh
```

Output:

```text
-rwx------ 1 varia varia 46 Sep 5 13:25 /home/varia/cyber-course/hello.sh
```

**Answer:** `700` means:

* Owner: read, write, execute
* Group: no permissions
* Others: no permissions

In other words, only the owner can read, modify, or execute the file.

---

# Part 9 Processes and system info

### Q28 — What does the `USER` column show?

Command:

```bash
$ ps aux | head -n 10
```

**Answer:** The `USER` column shows the user account that owns or started each process.

---

### Q29 — How much disk space is your `cyber-course` directory using?

Command:

```bash
$ du -sh ~/cyber-course/
```

**Answer:** The exact `du -sh` output was not captured in the provided session data, so the exact size of `cyber-course` cannot be reliably stated from the available evidence.

---

### Q30 — How much RAM does your VM have, and how much is currently used?

Command:

```bash
$ free -h
```

**Answer:** The exact `free -h` output was not captured in the provided session data, so the exact total and used RAM cannot be reliably stated.

---

# Part 10 Networking and downloads

### Q31 — What is your VM's IP address on the primary interface?

Command:

```bash
$ ip a
```

**Answer:** The `ip a` output was not included in the available session data, so the exact primary-interface IP address cannot be reliably stated.

---

### Q32 — Did both succeed? If one failed, what is the most likely reason?

Commands:

```bash
$ ping -c 4 1.1.1.1
$ ping -c 4 example.com
```

**Answer:** The actual `ping` output was not captured in the provided session data, so the success or failure of the two tests cannot be confirmed from the available evidence.

In general:

* If `1.1.1.1` works but `example.com` fails, the likely problem is DNS resolution.
* If both fail, the likely problem is network connectivity or routing.

---

### Q33 — Are the two files identical?

Commands:

```bash
$ wget https://www.debian.org/index.html -O ~/cyber-course/debian.html
$ curl https://www.debian.org/ -o ~/cyber-course/debian2.html
$ diff ~/cyber-course/debian.html ~/cyber-course/debian2.html
```

**Answer:** The two downloaded files have the same size in the recorded directory listing:

```text
debian.html   15856 bytes
debian2.html  15856 bytes
```

However, the actual `diff` output was not captured. Therefore, identical file contents cannot be conclusively confirmed from the available evidence based only on file size.

---

# Part 11 Package management and sudo

### Q34 — Did `sudo` ask for a password? Whose password?

Command:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

Output:

```text
Hit:1 http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie InRelease
Hit:2 http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security InRelease
Hit:3 http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates InRelease
1 package can be upgraded.
```

**Answer:** `sudo` uses the password of the current user, `varia`, not the root password. In the recorded `apt update` output, no password prompt was shown, which indicates that the existing `sudo` authentication was still valid.

---

### Q35 — Were any packages upgraded? Roughly how many?

Commands:

```bash
$ apt list --upgradable
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Output:

```text
firefox-esr/stable-security 140.15.0esr-1~deb13u1 arm64 [upgradable from: 140.14.0esr-1~deb13u1]
```

Upgrade summary:

```text
Upgrading:
  firefox-esr

Summary:
  Upgrading: 1, Installing: 0, Removing: 0, Not Upgrading: 0
```

**Answer:** Yes. **1 package** was upgraded: `firefox-esr`, from version `140.14.0esr-1~deb13u1` to `140.15.0esr-1~deb13u1`.

---

### Q36 — What's one thing `htop` shows you that `top` did not?

Commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt install htop
$ which htop
$ htop
```

Output:

```text
/usr/bin/htop
```

**Answer:** `htop` provides a more interactive and user-friendly process view. For example, it allows easier scrolling through processes and provides a clearer interactive interface for sorting and managing them.

---

### Q37 — What is `nmap`, according to the description?

Command:

```bash
$ apt search nmap
```

Output:

```text
nmap/stable 7.95+dfsg-3 arm64
  The Network Mapper
```

**Answer:** `nmap` is **The Network Mapper**, a network scanning and discovery tool.

---

# Part 12 Putting it together

### Q38 — Paste the commands you used. The output redirection (`>` and `>>`) is the key here.

**Working directory:** `/home/varia`

Commands:

```bash
$ mkdir report
$ hostname > ~/report/system-info.txt
$ whoami >> ~/report/system-info.txt
$ uname -a >> ~/report/system-info.txt
$ df -h >> ~/report/system-info.txt
$ date >> ~/report/system-info.txt
$ zip -r report.zip report/
$ unzip -l report.zip
```

Output from `system-info.txt`:

```text
debian-lab

Zip verification:

```text
Archive:  report.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
        0  2026-09-05 14:04   report/

---------                     -------
      786                     2 files
```

**Answer:** The `>` operator was used for the first command to create `system-info.txt`, while `>>` was used to append the remaining command outputs to the same file. The `report/` directory was then compressed into `report.zip` and verified with `unzip -l`.


## Reflection (150–200 words):

- Which command surprised you (positively or negatively)?
- Which command will you use most often, and why?
- What one thing about the Linux CLI is still confusing?

The command that surprised me most was find. It can search many files and folders very quickly. I also liked grep because it makes it easy to find specific text in files.

The command I will probably use most often is cd. I need it to move between directories and find the files I am working with. I will also use ls often because it shows what is inside a directory.

One thing that is still a little confusing is Linux permissions. I understand the basic idea of r, w, and x, but I sometimes forget what numbers like 700 and 755 mean. I need more practice with chmod.
